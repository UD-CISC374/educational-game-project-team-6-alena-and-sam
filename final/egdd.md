# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes
 
## Player Interaction Pattern

This is a game for one person. It’s you vs the world. You get to decide how adversarial that relationship will be.

## Player Modes
 
- Single player is the only mode
 
# Gameplay Objectives

- Build Wealth:
    - Description: Use your investment and saving options to build wealth over time
    - Alignment: This aligns with the objective of players being able to budget and invest
- Hoard Frogs:
    - Description: The dragon doesn’t just want to save money, he wants to spend some of it on his hoard of frogs. This brings the dragon a lot of joy.
    - Alignment: This aligns with the objective of players being able to budget

# Procedures/Actions
 
Click up arrow to buy a stock
Hold up arrow to buy many stocks
Click down arrow to sell a stock
Hold down arrow to sell many stocks
Button to go to next week
Button to go to frog store
Button to buy a frog
 
# Rules

The dragon gets paid $100 every week as a starting salary
If the player runs out of money, he loses
Buy frogs to expand the hoard.  You must obtain all types of frogs to win.
Buy stocks and invest to increase funds for frogs
There can be random events such as a stock crash. 

# Objects/Entities

The dragon has a bunch of variables that you need to optimize for
There are cards for the different types of stocks the dragon can invest in that display information about those stocks
There are frogs that just kind of hop around the dragon’s cave aimlessly once he buys them, the number of frogs influences the dragon’s happiness
 
## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)
   
- Buy/Sell Stock: The dragon is able to purchase Stock A, Stock B, and Stock C.  Each has a seperate volatility, and each gains or loses independently of the others.  The dragon must decide when and how much to invest in each one.   
- Buy frogs for frog hoard: The dragon likes frogs.  He can buy different types of frogs.  Fancier frogs are more expensive.  He is saving up for the most expensive frog, the rare golden panama frog.  
    

## Feedback

The player can view stock prices, number of each stock, amount of money in each stock, and frogs in the dragon’s cave.  The player must get at least one of each frog.  

So long as the player does not go bankrupt, the player is able to continue playing.  In the long term, a player either wins by saving enough money and buying all the frogs, or loses by failing to do so.  This is the long term feedback.  
 
# Story and Gameplay
 
## Presentation of Rules
 
A basic text tutorial runs at the top of the screen to aid players in understanding the rules.   
 
## Presentation of Content


Players learn the importance of investing, saving, and budgeting as they help the dragon to do these things in order to achieve his goals.  
 

## Story (Brief)
 
Drecko the Dragon lived through the rise and fall of the gold standard. He understands that times are a-changing and that the wealth-hoarding scene isn’t what it used to be. 

Follow Drecko as he dons a suit and tie and enters the workforce. 

## Story (Detailed)

A dragon realizes that he can use his wealth to purchase stocks and increase his funds, which can then be used to buy frogs.  He throws himself into achieveing this, and soon selects three stocks he likes and opens a savings account at the local bank.  

## Gameplay (Brief)

The player buys and sells stocks in order to purchase frogs from the frog store with their profits.  

## Gameplay (Detailed)

The player begins with $100 in the dragon cave.  There, the player can use the stone arrows next to each stock or account to divide their money into their chosen investment(s).  The tutorial text at the top informs them of this.  The player then is encouraged to click the "next week" button to go to the next week.  Each time the "next week" button is pressed, the value of each stock fluctuates and the savings account gains 0.05% interest.  Also the scene temporarily catches on fire.  Once the player has accumulated enough money, they can go to the frog store.  Here they can click a button placed beside a frog to buy that frog.  The buttons are labeled "buy".  They can exit back to the cave by clicking the large red exit sign.  Once all five frogs have been purchased, the win screen appears with the purchased frogs and some digital confetti.  A counter counts down from 104 weeks (2 years) to challenge the player to buy all the frogs in this time frame, but the game can be played even with negative weeks on the counter.  The counter is just to challenge the players who want it.  

# Assets Needed
 
## Aethestics


The aesthetics should be cute and silly. The game should be the kind that doesn’t take itself too seriously.
