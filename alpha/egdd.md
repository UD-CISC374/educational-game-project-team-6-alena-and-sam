# Procedures/Actions

Type amounts of money to invest into things like 401k
Buttons to choose between different stocks
Buttons to select how many frogs to buy and which kinds
 
# Rules

The dragon gets paid $375 every week as a starting salary
If the player runs out of money, he loses
The player must buy food to avoid starving
If you commit crimes, you go to federal prison
Buy frogs to expand the hoard.  You must obtain all types of frogs to win.
Buy stocks and invest to increase funds for frogs
There can be random events such as a computer breaking or a cave-in.
You must save enough money for retirement so the dragon can enjoy his golden years with his frogs.  

# Objects/Entities

The dragon has a bunch of variables that you need to optimize for
There are tax forms that you need to fill out
There are cards for the different types of stocks the dragon can invest in that display information about those stocks
There are frogs that just kind of hop around the dragon’s cave aimlessly once he buys them, the number of frogs influences the dragon’s happiness
 
## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)
 
- Invest in 401K: You can add money to the dragon’s 401K account to legally avoid paying taxes and grow his funds.  The money is in a retirement account, which the dragon is not old enough to pull funds from, but his employer matches 100% percent of his contributions.  
- Buy/Sell Stock: The dragon is able to purchase blue chip stocks (McDonkalds),income stocks (Allmart), penny stocks (Startup Inc.), and cyclical stocks (Boing Airlines).  Due to the coronavirus economy, the cyclical stocks have a very low price, and even the other stocks are cheaper.  The dragon must decide when he thinks the market is at its lowest and when it will grow to make the most of his investments.  
- Buy frogs for frog hoard: The dragon likes frogs.  He can buy different types of frogs.  Fancier frogs are more expensive.  He is saving up for the most expensive frog, the rare desert rain frog.  
- Do taxes (correctly or incorrectly - that’s up to you):  The dragon receives a W-2 form from his employer.  He will also get a 1099-INT form if he earns dividends from income stock.  Then he fills out a 1040 form.  This includes information such as his filing status and any deductions or dependents.  
- If the dragon evades taxes he gets audited by the IRS and put in federal prison.  His frog assets are seized and the player loses the game.
    
## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/etc. indicators there that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

## Feedback

The player can view retirement savings, stock values, number of each frog species, and other funds in the dragon’s cave.  The retirement savings has a bar that must be filled.  The player must fill the bar and also get at least one of each frog.  

So long as the player does not go bankrupt or get put in federal prison, the player is able to continue playing.  In the long term, a player either wins by saving enough money and buying all the frogs, or loses by breaking the law or going bankrupt.  This is the long term feedback.
